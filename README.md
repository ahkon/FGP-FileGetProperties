# FGP-FileGetProperties
[AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) functions to retrieve extended file properties.

[Forum thread](https://autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=3806)

File property names and numbers will vary depending on your system. This is the reason the functions generate a static look-up table.

Files will not necessarily have values for every property. For example, the "Authors" property is used by some MSOffice files, but it is blank the majority of the time.
